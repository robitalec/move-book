The Landsat Net Primary Production (NPP) CONUS dataset estimates NPP using Landsat Surface Reflectance for CONUS. NPP is the amount of carbon captured by plants in an ecosystem, after accounting for losses due to respiration. NPP is calculated using the MOD17 algorithm (see MOD17 User Guide) with Landsat Surface Reflectance, gridMET, and the National Land Cover Database.

The MOD17A3HGF V6 product provides information about annual Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at 500m pixel resolution. Annual NPP is derived from the sum of all 8-day Net Photosynthesis (PSN) products (MOD17A2H) from the given year. The PSN value is the difference of the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and the Maintenance Respiration (MR) (GPP-MR).
