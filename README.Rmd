# Movebank summarizer

This project scraps and summarizes data sets available on [Movebank](movebank.org/).
There is a huge diversity of data sources with varying license terms, public access/not, 
taxa. This is an attempt to better understand how accessible and relevant data are
for my own project. I'm hoping to wrap this up as a more general-use template, so if 
that's something you would be interested in - please open an issue and we can discuss. 
I'd rather do that with an idea of what others are looking for. 

We use a number of packages for downloading ([`rmoveapi`](https://github.com/benscarlson/rmoveapi)), processing ([`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/), [`anytime`](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/anytime)) and visualizing ([`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), [`leaflet`](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/)) the data.
All steps are wrapped up in a [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) workflow, and package versions tracked with [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/). 





Setup:

Make a movebank account
Save your credentials with [`keyring`](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring/)
Edit the credentials section in the targets
Download the desired 

```{r}

```

## Caveats/lessons learned
If you are hoping to do something similar, I have two main lessons learned:
* Reduce the data to only what you need as quickly as possible, without going far into analysis or processing. This is directly related to...
* The data is not homogeneous. Data types do not appear to be strictly enforced, there are many duplicated study names (though not study ids thankfully), and there are NAs or errors throughout. This makes it hard to apply the same functions, or combine different datasets programmatically. 

Some things to watch out for:

* duplicated study names (see [here](https://gitlab.com/bartk/move/-/issues/52))
* errors in dates (eg. typos, impossible study period date/end ranges)
* taxons provided are often a list of different taxonomies or taxonomic ranks
* pay attention to the [Movebank API doc](https://github.com/movebank/movebank-api-doc)
