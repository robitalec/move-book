The Landsat Net Primary Production (NPP) CONUS dataset estimates NPP using Landsat Surface Reflectance for CONUS. NPP is the amount of carbon captured by plants in an ecosystem, after accounting for losses due to respiration. NPP is calculated using the MOD17 algorithm (see MOD17 User Guide) with Landsat Surface Reflectance, gridMET, and the National Land Cover Database.
